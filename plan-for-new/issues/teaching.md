1. [ ] why are there only two lecture series included? (Maybe the others were hard-coded?)

2. [ ] the teaching entries are not links; clicking them does nothing

3. [ ] transfer the old pages (e.g. https://www.butterfill.com/teaching/joint_action_and_the_emergence.html) to the new site. I maybe do not have the source for that but I can download the docs and re-create the work on the new site
