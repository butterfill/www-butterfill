## Project: Website Migration from Docpad to Astro

### 1. Project Overview

**1.1. Goal:**
To migrate the personal academic website of Stephen Butterfill from the legacy Docpad static site generator to the modern Astro framework.

**1.2. Scope:**
The project includes:
*   **Preservation:** Replicating all existing content, structure, and core functionality of the current website.
*   **Modernization:** Rebuilding the site with a new, maintainable technology stack centered around Astro and Markdown.
*   **Enhancement:** Implementing a set of new features to improve user experience, maintainability, and utility for modern applications (e.g., Large Language Models).

**1.3. Guiding Principles:**
*   **Automation over Manual Labor:** The migration process for existing content should be scripted to the greatest extent possible to ensure accuracy and efficiency.
*   **Content-First:** The new architecture must make adding and updating content (publications, talks, etc.) as simple as adding a Markdown file.
*   **Performance and Readability:** The final site must be fast, responsive on all devices, and highly readable, adhering to a clean, professional aesthetic.

---

### 2. Core Technology Stack

**2.1. Primary Framework:**
*   **Requirement:** The website will be built using **Astro**.
*   **Justification:** Astro is ideal for content-heavy static sites, offering excellent performance ("zero JS by default"), a component-based architecture, and first-class support for Markdown/MDX.

**2.2. Content Format:**
*   **Requirement:** All primary content (publications, talks, teaching pages, etc.) will be stored in **Markdown (`.md`)** or **MDX (`.mdx`)** files with YAML frontmatter.
*   **Justification:** This decouples content from presentation, simplifies content creation, and is the standard for modern static site generators. MDX will be used if components need to be embedded directly within content.

**2.3. Styling:**
*   **Requirement:** A new, consistent styling system will be implemented to meet the design goals.
*   **Options:**
    1.  **Tailwind CSS (Recommended):** A utility-first CSS framework that aligns perfectly with the component-based nature of Astro and the aesthetic of `zed.dev`.
        *   **Pros:** Highly customizable, promotes consistency, avoids writing large amounts of custom CSS, excellent performance when purged.
        *   **Cons:** Steeper learning curve if unfamiliar; can lead to verbose HTML if not managed with components.
    2.  **Modernized CSS/Sass:** Writing custom CSS or Sass from scratch, potentially with a lightweight reset.
        *   **Pros:** Full control over the final CSS.
        *   **Cons:** More time-consuming, harder to maintain consistency without a strict methodology.
*   **Decision:** The plan should default to using Tailwind CSS, as it best fits the "low key, highly readable, somewhat nerdy" requirement.

**2.4. Interactivity:**
*   **Requirement:** For interactive elements like the command palette, a lightweight JavaScript solution will be used.
*   **Options:**
    1.  **Pre-built Library:** Use a library like `cmdk` for the command palette.
    2.  **Custom Implementation:** Write a small, custom JavaScript module.
*   **Decision:** A pre-built, headless library is preferred to save development time while allowing for full style customization.

---

### 3. Content & Data Migration Strategy

**3.1. Automated Migration Script:**
*   **Requirement:** A one-time script (e.g., Node.js) must be developed to automate the conversion of existing content.
*   **Script Responsibilities:**
    1.  **Parse Source Files:** Read all `.jade` and `.html.md` files from the `src/documents/` directory.
    2.  **Extract Frontmatter:** Parse the CSON frontmatter from the source files and convert it to standard YAML for the new Markdown files.
    3.  **Standardize Frontmatter:** Define and enforce a consistent schema for frontmatter across different content types (e.g., `writing`, `talks`, `teaching`). This includes standardizing date formats.
    4.  **Convert Content Body:**
        *   For `.html.md` files, the Markdown body can be used directly.
        *   For `.jade` files, the script must convert Jade syntax to Markdown/HTML. This is a critical and potentially complex step.
    5.  **Create New File Structure:** Organize the new Markdown files into Astro's `src/content/` collections structure (e.g., `src/content/writing/`, `src/content/talks/`).
    6.  **Handle Static Assets:** Copy over related assets like PDFs and images, maintaining their associations with the new content files.

**3.2. Target Content Structure:**
*   **Requirement:** The migration will result in the following content collections:
    *   `src/content/writing/`: One Markdown file per publication.
    *   `src/content/talks/`: One Markdown file per talk.
    *   `src/content/teaching/`: One Markdown file per course.
*   **Frontmatter Schema Example (for a publication):**
    ```yaml

### 4. Functional Requirements (Features)

**4.1. General Site Structure & Navigation (Preservation & Enhancement)**
*   **FR-1:** The site must have a main homepage (`/`) that serves as a dashboard, listing recent publications and providing navigation to all major sections.
*   **FR-2:** A persistent sidebar navigation component must be present on the homepage, linking to the main sections (Writing, Talks, etc.). This sidebar should intelligently highlight the current section when scrolling.
*   **FR-3:** The header section must be redesigned to be cleaner and more modern, containing the author's name, contact info, and a brief bio.

**4.2. Writing / Publications Section (Enhancement)**
*   **FR-4:** The `/writing` page (or a section on the homepage) must list all publications, sorted chronologically (newest first).
*   **FR-5:** Each publication must have its own dedicated page (e.g., `/writing/joint-action-development/`).
*   **FR-6:** The publication page must display all relevant metadata (title, authors, journal, year, DOI, etc.) in a clean, standardized format.
*   **FR-7:** The publication page must display the full text of the paper, rendered from its corresponding Markdown file.
*   **FR-8:** The publication page must provide a clear link to download the associated PDF.

**4.3. Talks Section (Preservation & Enhancement)**
*   **FR-9:** The `/talks` page (or a section on the homepage) must list all talks, separated into "Future" and "Recent" sections, sorted chronologically.
*   **FR-10:** Each talk with an abstract or slides must have its own dedicated page.
*   **FR-11:** The talk page must display all relevant metadata (title, event, location, date).
*   **FR-12:** The talk page must provide links to download handouts and slides (PDFs).
*   **FR-13 (Slide Previews):** The existing `deck.js` slide functionality must be preserved.
    *   **Option A (Low Effort):** Keep the existing generated HTML slide decks as static assets and embed them in an `<iframe>` on the talk page.
        *   **Pros:** Very fast to implement, guarantees preservation of the exact look.
        *   **Cons:** Not responsive, uses legacy technology (jQuery), not maintainable.
    *   **Option B (High Effort, Recommended):** Migrate the slide content (images) to a modern slide framework like Reveal.js (which Astro has integrations for) or a simple Astro component.
        *   **Pros:** Modern, responsive, maintainable, better performance.
        *   **Cons:** Requires more development effort during migration.

**4.4. Teaching Section (Preservation & Enhancement)**
*   **FR-14:** The `/teaching` page (or a section on the homepage) must list all courses.
*   **FR-15:** Each course must have its own page, displaying the course description and a list of lectures.
*   **FR-16:** Each lecture must provide links to its materials (handouts, slides, YouTube videos).

**4.5. LLM Integration (New Feature)**
*   **FR-17 (`llms.txt`):** The build process must generate a single `llms.txt` file in the root of the output directory. This file must contain:
    1.  A preamble identifying the site and author.
    2.  A structured concatenation of the full text of every publication, clearly demarcated.
*   **FR-18 ("Copy for Chat" Button):** Every publication and talk page must feature a "Copy for Chat" button.
    *   When clicked, this button will copy a formatted plain-text version of the page's content to the user's clipboard.
    *   The format should be optimized for pasting into an LLM prompt, including the title, authors, abstract, and full text, with clear headings.

**4.6. Command Palette (New Feature)**
*   **FR-19:** A command palette must be implemented, accessible via a keyboard shortcut (e.g., `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`).
*   **FR-20:** The palette must provide a fuzzy-search interface for navigating to any page on the site (publications, talks, etc.).
*   **FR-21 (Context-Aware Actions):** When opened on a publication page, the command palette must include specific actions for that publication, such as:
    *   "Download PDF"
    *   "Copy BibTeX Citation"
    *   "Copy Full Text"

**4.7. Utility Pages (Preservation)**
*   **FR-22 (`hashme`):** The `hashme-q3.html` utility must be preserved with identical functionality. It should be an Astro page with its client-side JavaScript included inline.

---

### 5. Non-Functional Requirements

**5.1. Styling & User Experience (UX):**
*   **NFR-1:** The design must be fully responsive, providing an excellent experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
*   **NFR-2:** The aesthetic should be inspired by `zed.dev`: minimalist, professional, text-focused, and "nerdy". High readability is paramount.
*   **NFR-3:** A dark mode option should be considered and implemented if time permits.

**5.2. Performance:**
*   **NFR-4:** The site must achieve a Lighthouse performance score of 95+ for all static pages.
*   **NFR-5:** Page loads should be near-instantaneous, leveraging Astro's static generation and partial hydration capabilities.

**5.3. Accessibility:**
*   **NFR-6:** The site must adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards. This includes semantic HTML, proper color contrast, and keyboard navigability for all elements, including the command palette.

**5.4. Build Process & Deployment:**
*   **NFR-7:** The build process must be simple, executed via a single `npm run build` command.
*   **NFR-8:** The output must be a fully static site (HTML, CSS, JS, assets) deployable to any static hosting provider (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, S3).
*   **NFR-9:** The build process must include the generation of the `llms.txt` file.

**5.5. Maintainability:**
*   **NFR-10:** The new codebase must be well-structured and easy to understand.
*   **NFR-11:** Adding a new publication, talk, or course should require only the creation of a new Markdown file and its associated assets (e.g., PDF), with no changes to layout code.

---

### 6. Potential Challenges & Risks

*   **C-1: Jade to Markdown/HTML Conversion:** The `.jade` files contain logic and specific syntax that may not have a direct 1-to-1 mapping in Markdown or Astro components. The automated script may handle 80-90% of cases, but manual review and cleanup of each converted file will likely be necessary.
*   **C-2: `deck.js` Slide Preservation:** The existing slide functionality is dependent on jQuery and a specific set of CSS files. Integrating this legacy system into a modern Astro site could be complex. The `iframe` approach (Option A) is safer but provides a poorer user experience. The full migration (Option B) is better but adds significant scope.
*   **C-3: Data Consistency:** The frontmatter in the original files may be inconsistent. The migration script must be robust enough to handle variations or a manual data cleaning phase may be required before running the script.
*   **C-4: Command Palette Complexity:** The context-aware actions for the command palette require passing page-specific data to a client-side component, which needs careful implementation in Astro.

---

### 7. Out of Scope

*   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** The site will be fully static. No server-side logic will be implemented.
*   **Content Management System (CMS):** Content will be managed directly via Markdown files in the Git repository. No external CMS will be integrated.
*   **New Content Creation:** This project covers only the migration of existing content. No new publications, talks, or other content will be created as part of this project.



# why react (or not)?

That's an excellent point and a crucial consideration for the project's success and your long-term comfort with the codebase. My initial suggestions leaned towards the React ecosystem (MDX, `cmdk`) primarily due to its vastness and the high probability of an LLM generating correct, idiomatic code for it.

However, your preference for Svelte and aversion to React's "clunkiness" are perfectly valid and important constraints. Astro's framework-agnostic nature is one of its greatest strengths, so we can absolutely choose a path that aligns better with your skills and preferences.

Let's evaluate the alternatives, keeping your core requirements in mind:
1.  **Developer Experience (DX):** How enjoyable and intuitive is it for you to work with?
2.  **LLM Compatibility:** How well can an LLM generate high-quality, maintainable code for it?
3.  **Ecosystem & Maturity:** How easy is it to find high-quality, pre-built solutions (like a command palette)?

---

### Evaluation of UI Framework Alternatives for Astro

Here are the primary options for adding interactivity to your Astro site:

#### 1. Svelte (Your Preferred Choice)

*   **Developer Experience (DX):** **Excellent.** Svelte is renowned for its elegant, concise, and intuitive syntax. It feels like writing enhanced HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The learning curve is gentle, especially if you already have some experience with it. It directly addresses your concern about React's "clunkiness."

*   **LLM Compatibility:** **Good, but with caveats.**
    *   LLMs have been trained on a substantial amount of Svelte code. They can certainly generate Svelte components.
    *   However, the volume of Svelte training data is a fraction of React's. This means the LLM might occasionally produce less idiomatic code, require more specific prompting, or fall back on older patterns.
    *   The recent introduction of Svelte 5 and its "Runes" syntax is a major change. LLMs may not be fully proficient with this new paradigm yet, potentially generating code for the older Svelte 4 syntax. This is a manageable but important consideration.

*   **Ecosystem & Maturity:** **Good and Growing.**
    *   The Svelte ecosystem is vibrant but smaller than React's.
    *   For a command palette, you won't use `cmdk` directly, but excellent alternatives exist, such as `svelte-cmdk` or by adapting a headless vanilla JS library. This is a very solvable problem.
    *   For most common UI needs, you will find a Svelte solution.

*   **Astro Integration:** **Excellent.** Astro has a first-class integration for Svelte. You can drop `.svelte` files into your `src/components/` directory and use them in `.astro` or Markdown files with minimal friction.

#### 2. Vanilla JavaScript / Web Components (The Minimalist Approach)

*   **Developer Experience (DX):** **Variable.** For small, isolated tasks (like a "Copy to Clipboard" button), it's excellent—simple, direct, and no framework overhead. For more complex, stateful components like a command palette, it can quickly become difficult to manage state and structure without the conventions a framework provides. It requires more discipline to keep the code clean.

*   **LLM Compatibility:** **Excellent.** This is the universal language of the web. Any LLM is exceptionally proficient at generating vanilla JavaScript. You can ask for specific patterns (e.g., "write this as a class," "use the observer pattern") and get high-quality results. The challenge isn't generating the code, but prompting the LLM to structure it in a maintainable way.

*   **Ecosystem & Maturity:** **Infinite.** The entire JavaScript ecosystem is at your disposal. You can find countless headless, framework-agnostic libraries for things like fuzzy searching and command palettes (e.g., `KBar`, `Command-K`).

*   **Astro Integration:** **Perfect.** This is Astro's native tongue. You use standard `<script>` tags within Astro components to create "islands" of interactivity. Performance is maximal as there is zero framework overhead.

#### 3. React (Re-evaluation)

*   **Developer Experience (DX):** **Fair (for you).** As you noted, JSX and the React component model can feel verbose and clunky if you're not accustomed to it. The learning curve for its concepts (hooks, state management) is steeper than Svelte's.

*   **LLM Compatibility:** **Excellent (The Gold Standard).** This remains React's key advantage in this context. The sheer volume of high-quality React code (documentation, open-source projects, Stack Overflow) in the training data is unparalleled. An LLM is most likely to produce correct, modern, and idiomatic code for React with the least amount of prompt engineering.

*   **Ecosystem & Maturity:** **Excellent.** The largest ecosystem by a wide margin. Libraries like `cmdk` are polished and powerful. For almost any problem, a battle-tested React solution exists.

*   **Astro Integration:** **Excellent.** Astro has a first-class integration for React.

---

### Addressing Specific Feature Requirements

Let's see how these choices impact the new features you want.

**A. MDX (React-based) vs. Astro's Component-in-Markdown:**

This is a critical point. You are correct that **MDX is a React-based technology**. It allows you to `import` React components and use them directly in Markdown with JSX syntax.

**However, you do not need MDX to use components in Markdown with Astro.**

Astro has a built-in feature that lets you import and use components from **any supported framework (including Svelte or Vanilla JS Astro components)** directly in standard `.md` files.

**Example with a Svelte component:**
```markdown
---
title: 'My Publication'
layout: '../../layouts/WritingLayout.astro'
# ... other frontmatter
---
import MySvelteCounter from '../../components/MySvelteCounter.svelte';

Here is some text in my paper.

<MySvelteCounter client:load />

Here is more text.
```
This is a huge advantage. It means **you are not locked into React** just because you want to embed interactive components in your content. This significantly weakens the case for forcing React into the project.

**B. Command Palette (`cmdk`):**

*   `cmdk` is a React library.
*   **Svelte Path:** You would use a library like `svelte-cmdk` or find a headless vanilla JS library and wrap it in a Svelte component to manage state. This is very feasible.
*   **Vanilla JS Path:** You would use a headless library like `KBar` and initialize it within a `<script>` tag in your main layout.

### Summary Table & Recommendation

| Criteria                  | React                               | Svelte                              | Vanilla JS / Web Components         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Developer Experience**  | Fair (for you)                      | **Excellent**                       | Good (for simple), Fair (for complex) |
| **LLM Compatibility**     | **Excellent**                       | Good                                | **Excellent**                       |

| **Performance Overhead**  | Small                               | **Minimal**                         | **None**                            |

### Recommended Path

Given your preferences and the capabilities of Astro, I recommend a **hybrid, Svelte-first approach.**

**1. Use Svelte for Complex Interactive Components:**
   *   Build the **Command Palette** as a Svelte component. This is the most complex piece of interactivity. It will benefit from Svelte's state management and component structure, and you will enjoy building it more. The LLM will be a capable assistant, even if it requires slightly more guidance than for React.
   *   If any other similarly complex components arise, use Svelte for them as well.

**2. Use Vanilla JavaScript for Simple, Isolated Interactions:**
   *   For the **"Copy for Chat" button**, a few lines of vanilla JavaScript in a `<script>` tag on the component is the most efficient and performant solution. There is no need for a full framework for this.
   *   The `hashme-q3` page should also remain a plain HTML/JS implementation, wrapped in an Astro page for layout.

**3. Use Standard Markdown (`.md`) for all content.**
   *   Avoid MDX entirely. Leverage Astro's native ability to import and use your Svelte or Astro components directly within your publication and talk pages.

**Why this approach is best:**

*   **Plays to Your Strengths:** It prioritizes the technology you know and prefer for the most significant development task (the command palette).
*   **Minimizes Friction:** It avoids forcing you to learn and work with a framework you find clunky.
*   **Pragmatic Performance:** It uses the most lightweight solution (vanilla JS) for the simplest tasks, and a highly-performant framework (Svelte) for more complex ones.
*   **Leverages Astro's Strengths:** It fully utilizes Astro's "bring your own framework" and component-in-Markdown features, which is the ideal way to work with Astro.
*   **Mitigates LLM Risk:** The primary risk (LLM struggling with Svelte) is contained to one or two components. For the vast majority of the site (content, layouts, simple scripts), the LLM will be operating in its strongest domains (Markdown, HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS).

This strategy offers the best balance, respecting your expertise and preferences while still building a modern, maintainable, and feature-rich website.


# keep or ditch jade?

That's an excellent point to raise. My initial recommendation to ditch Jade (now officially called Pug) was based on creating the most modern, maintainable, and "idiomatic" Astro project possible. However, keeping it is a valid strategy, especially to reduce initial migration effort.

Let's break down the pros and cons in detail, with a special focus on your key consideration: using LLMs for code assistance.

***

### Analysis: Keeping Pug vs. Migrating to Astro/Markdown

#### **Option 1: Keep Pug for Layouts and Complex Pages**

In this scenario, we would use the `@astrojs/pug` integration. The migration would look like this:
*   **Content (`.jade` files in `writing/`, `talks/`, etc.):** These would still be converted to Markdown (`.md`) files and placed in Astro's `src/content/` collections. This part of the plan remains the same, as content should be decoupled from presentation.
*   **Layouts (`.jade` files in `layouts/`):** These would be kept as `.pug` files. The migration script would only need to update them to work within Astro's layout system (e.g., using `<slot />` instead of `!= content`).
*   **Homepage (`index.html.jade`):** This complex file, which contains logic for listing publications and talks, would remain a `.pug` file in `src/pages/`.

---

#### **Pros of Keeping Pug**

1.  **Reduced Initial Migration Effort:** This is the most significant advantage. The automated script would be much simpler. It wouldn't need to translate Pug's logic (loops, conditionals, mixins) into Astro's JSX-like syntax. This directly mitigates the risk of conversion errors (`C-1` from the requirements doc).
2.  **Preservation of Existing Logic:** The logic for iterating over collections on the homepage is already written and works. Keeping it in Pug avoids the need to re-implement and debug it in a new language.
3.  **Developer Familiarity:** You are already familiar with the Pug syntax, which could speed up initial modifications to the existing layouts.
4.  **Technical Feasibility:** Astro has an official integration for Pug, so it is a supported and viable path.

---

#### **Cons of Keeping Pug**

1.  **The LLM Factor (Crucial):** This is the strongest argument against keeping Pug.
    *   **Training Data Bias:** LLMs like GPT-4, Claude, and Copilot are trained on vast public code repositories. The prevalence of HTML, JSX (React/Vue), and Astro's `.astro` file syntax is orders of magnitude greater than Pug.
    *   **Lower Quality & Reliability of Generated Code:** When you ask an LLM to "add a feature to this Pug file," you are more likely to encounter:
        *   **Syntax Errors:** The LLM might forget Pug's strict indentation rules or mix in HTML syntax (e.g., adding a closing `</div>`).
        *   **Hallucinations:** It might invent Pug features that don't exist or use syntax from older, incompatible versions of Jade/Pug.
        *   **Incorrect Integration:** Asking it to integrate a modern Astro feature (like a View Transition or an Island component) into a Pug template is a complex, non-standard request. The LLM is much less likely to succeed compared to asking it to do the same in a `.astro` file.
    *   **Friction in Workflow:** You will spend more time correcting the LLM's output for Pug files than you would for `.astro` files. The promise of LLM-assisted development is significantly diminished when working with a less common templating language.

2.  **Astro Ecosystem & "Second-Class Citizen" Status:**
    *   While Pug is *supported*, it is not a *first-class citizen* in the Astro ecosystem. Astro's core features, documentation, and community support are overwhelmingly focused on `.astro` components and Markdown/MDX for content.
    *   **Content Collections:** Astro's powerful Content Collections API is designed to work seamlessly with Markdown and MDX, providing type-safety and a great developer experience. Using it to feed data into Pug pages is possible but less direct and more cumbersome than using it with `.astro` pages.
    *   **Tooling & Editor Support:** Features like syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and formatting are far more robust and well-maintained for `.astro` files than for Pug within an Astro project.

3.  **Increased Project Complexity & Cognitive Overhead:**
    *   Your project would have **three** different templating/markup languages:
        1.  **Pug:** For main layouts and the homepage.
        2.  **Astro Components (`.astro`):** For all new, reusable components (like the command palette, header, sidebar).
        3.  **Markdown/MDX:** For the actual content of publications and talks.
    *   This creates a mental tax. You and any future developers (including LLMs) will have to constantly switch contexts and remember how to pass data and interact between these different file types. A homogenous `.astro` and `.md` structure is far simpler.

4.  **Reduced Future-Proofing and Portability:**
    *   Pug's popularity has waned in favor of JSX-like syntaxes. By migrating away from it now, you are making your site's presentation layer more aligned with modern standards.
    *   If you ever need to migrate away from Astro in the future, having your layouts in `.astro` (which is just HTML with JS expressions) makes them far more portable to other frameworks than Pug files would be.

---

### **Recommendation**

Despite the higher initial effort, **I strongly recommend a full migration away from Pug to Astro components and Markdown/MDX.**

The one-time cost of converting the Pug files will be paid back many times over during the long-term maintenance and enhancement of the site. The benefits in terms of **LLM assistance, ecosystem integration, project simplicity, and future-proofing** are substantial.

The friction you would encounter trying to get an LLM to reliably generate and modify Pug code integrated with Astro features would likely negate the time saved by not performing the initial conversion.

### **A Practical, Phased Migration Plan**

To balance the pros and cons, we can adopt a phased approach that still leads to the ideal end state:

1.  **Phase 1: Automated Conversion (The "Good Enough" Pass):**
    *   Write and run the migration script to convert all `.jade` files to `.astro` files.
    *   The script will handle the straightforward parts: basic structure, converting attributes, and simple loops.
    *   **Acknowledge Imperfection:** Accept that the script will not produce perfect, idiomatic Astro code. The goal is to get a *working* site, even if the converted components are a bit messy.

2.  **Phase 2: Manual Cleanup & New Feature Development:**
    *   Manually review and fix the auto-generated `.astro` files to ensure they render correctly. Don't strive for perfection yet, just functionality.
    *   Build all the **new features** (command palette, new header/footer, `llms.txt` generation, "Copy for Chat" button) using clean, idiomatic Astro components from scratch. This ensures the most complex and interactive parts of the site are built on a solid, modern foundation.

3.  **Phase 3: Incremental Refactoring (Optional, As-Needed):**
    *   Over time, as you need to make changes to older parts of the site (e.g., the homepage layout), take the opportunity to refactor the auto-generated `.astro` code into cleaner, more componentized versions.

This approach gives you the best of both worlds: it uses automation to handle the bulk of the tedious work upfront, allows you to immediately leverage the full power of Astro and LLMs for new development, and defers the "perfection" of old layouts to a later, more manageable stage.
