### **Project Implementation Plan: Website Migration**

#### **Phase 1: Core Prototype & Foundation (1-2 Weeks)**

**Goal:** To rapidly develop a minimal, functional version of the new site. This prototype will use the new Astro and Svelte stack, demonstrate the content collection structure, and be deployable for stakeholder review. It will use a small, manually created set of sample content.

*   **1.1. Project Initialization:**
    *   Initialize a new Astro project.
    *   Install and configure all core dependencies: Svelte and Tailwind CSS.
    *   Establish the foundational directory structure: `src/content/`, `src/layouts/`, `src/components/`, `src/pages/`, and `public/`.

*   **1.2. Content Schema & Sample Data:**
    *   Define the Astro Content Collection schemas for `writing`, `talks`, and `teaching` as specified in the requirements (3.2).
    *   Manually create 2-3 sample Markdown files for each collection (e.g., two publications, two talks). These files will serve as the canonical examples of the new content format.

*   **1.3. Basic Page & Layout Construction:**
    *   Create a primary `Layout.astro` component that includes the basic HTML shell, header, and footer.
    *   Implement a clean, modern header component with the author's name and contact info (FR-3).
    *   Build the dynamic list pages:
        *   `/writing`: A page that fetches and lists the sample publications from the content collection (FR-4).
        *   `/talks`: A page that fetches and lists the sample talks (FR-9).
    *   Build the dynamic detail page templates:
        *   `src/pages/writing/[...slug].astro`: A template that renders a single publication, displaying its metadata and Markdown content (FR-5, FR-6, FR-7).

*   **1.4. Initial Styling:**
    *   Apply foundational styling using Tailwind CSS to align with the minimalist, `zed.dev`-inspired aesthetic (NFR-2). Focus on typography, layout, and readability for the prototype pages.

*   **1.5. Prototype Deployment:**
    *   Deploy the prototype site to a staging environment (e.g., Netlify, Vercel) for review and feedback.

**Deliverable for Phase 1:** A live URL of the prototype site demonstrating the new technology, file structure, and basic look and feel.

#### **Phase 2: Feature Implementation (2-3 Weeks)**

**Goal:** To build the key interactive and functional enhancements specified in the requirements, transforming the prototype into a feature-complete site (still using the sample data).

*   **2.1. Command Palette Implementation:**
    *   Integrate the `shadcn-svelte` Svelte library.
    *   Develop the command palette Svelte component, triggered by `Cmd/Ctrl+K` (FR-19).
    *   Implement the fuzzy search to navigate to all sample content pages (FR-20).
    *   Implement context-aware actions for the publication page (e.g., "Copy BibTeX," "Download PDF") by passing data from Astro to the Svelte component (FR-21).

*   **2.2. LLM & Utility Features:**
    *   Create the "Copy for Chat" Svelte component and add it to the publication and talk page templates (FR-18).
    *   Modify the build process to generate the `llms.txt` file from the content collections (FR-17, NFR-9).
    *   Migrate the `hashme-q3.html` utility into an Astro page (FR-22).

*   **2.3. Navigation and UX Refinement:**
    *   Implement the persistent sidebar navigation component (FR-2).
    *   Add the JavaScript required for the sidebar to intelligently highlight the current section on scroll.
    *   Thoroughly test and refine the site's responsiveness across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports (NFR-1).

**Deliverable for Phase 2:** The prototype URL updated with all new features (Command Palette, LLM tools, sidebar) fully functional.

#### **Phase 3: Automated Content & Asset Migration (2 Weeks)**

**Goal:** To develop, execute, and verify the automated script that will migrate all content from the legacy Docpad site into the new Astro content structure.

*   **3.1. Develop Migration Script:**
    *   Create a Node.js script to handle the migration tasks (3.1).
    *   **Task 1: Parsing:** Read all source `.jade` and `.html.md` files.
    *   **Task 2: Frontmatter:** Convert CSON frontmatter to the new, standardized YAML schema. Handle potential inconsistencies in the source data (C-3).
    *   **Task 3: Content Body:** Convert `.jade` syntax to Markdown/HTML. This is a high-risk task and the script should flag files that require manual intervention (C-1).
    *   **Task 4: File Structure:** Write the new `.md` files to the correct content collection directories (`src/content/writing/`, etc.).
    *   **Task 5: Asset Handling:** Copy all associated assets (PDFs, images) to the `public/` directory, ensuring they can be correctly referenced from the new content files.

*   **3.2. Execute and Verify Migration:**
    *   Run the migration script on the entire Docpad source.
    *   **Crucial Step:** Manually review and clean up every converted file to correct any errors from the automated process.
    *   Build the Astro site with the full set of migrated content and debug any issues that arise.

**Deliverable for Phase 3:** A local, fully populated website with all historical content migrated and rendering correctly.

#### **Phase 4: Finalization, Slide Migration & Launch (1-2 Weeks)**

**Goal:** To address the final complex feature (slide decks), conduct final testing, and deploy the completed website to production.

*   **4.1. Handle `deck.js` Slide Decks (FR-13):**
    *   Make a final decision on the migration strategy.
    *   **Recommended (Option B):** Migrate slide content to a modern, responsive framework like Reveal.js, integrated via a simple Astro component. This provides the best long-term value.
    *   **Contingency (Option A):** If time is critical, copy the legacy slide decks as-is and embed them using `<iframe>`s on the talk pages.

*   **4.2. Final Testing and Optimization:**
    *   Conduct a full audit for accessibility to ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (NFR-6).
    *   Run Lighthouse performance tests on key pages and optimize to achieve a score of 95+ (NFR-4).
    *   Perform cross-browser and cross-device testing to ensure a consistent experience.

*   **4.3. Production Deployment:**
    *   Finalize the production build process (`npm run build`).
    *   Deploy the final, static output to the production hosting provider (NFR-8).
    *   Update DNS records to point the domain to the new site.

**Deliverable for Phase 4:** The live, public-facing website, fully migrated, functional, and performant.
