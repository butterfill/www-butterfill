Thinking of migrating my static website from docpad to a new system and making some improvements. 

## build
- move from docpad to a more modern static site builder; could be custom (I like vite and sveltekit but happy to consider alternatives; no react.js unless there is a very good reason for it)
- we will write code to convert existing content files into new formats
- my publications list needs to be based on a yaml file which, for each publication, contains the bibtex entry plus any additional links or info
- the lists of my lectures and talks likewise need to be built from yaml files

## functionality
- retain all existing functions

## LLMs
- build process must include llms.txt
- each content page should have a `copy for chat` button which creates text suitable for pasting into a chat

## styling
- must work on desktop and mobile
- make it more readable
- should look slightly better overall but not too different and not flashy
- low key, highly readable; somewhat nerdy
- zed.dev is ideal for style
